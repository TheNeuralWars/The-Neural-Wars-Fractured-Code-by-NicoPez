## "The Neural Wars: Fractured Code" - Visual Design Authority & Adaptation Guide

### Visual Identity Framework

**Core Aesthetic Philosophy**
"The Neural Wars: Fractured Code" visual identity balances organic humanity with enhanced consciousness technology. The design language avoids cyberpunk's dark nihilism and sterile sci-fi minimalism, instead creating a warm, tactile future where technology serves rather than dominates human experience.

**Color Psychology & Meaning**
- **Indigo Luminescence**: Consciousness enhancement, Cascade sensitivity, authentic connection
- **Optimization White**: False perfection, sterile control, artificial harmony
- **Street Earth Tones**: Underground authenticity, resistance communities, human warmth
- **Cosmic Deep Blues**: Galactic consciousness, infinite potential, universal connection
- **Blood Copper**: Neural strain, transformation cost, organic reality
