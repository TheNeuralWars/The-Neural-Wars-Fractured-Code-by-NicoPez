# Final Formatting & Style Guide
## "The Neural Wars: Fractured Code" (Book 1)

### Literary Standards

**Voice & Tone**
- **Narrative Style**: Third-person limited omniscient with deep POV immersion
- **Prose Density**: High literary density with sensory precision and visceral immediacy
- **Emotional Register**: Intimate psychological realism balanced with cosmic scope
- **Technical Integration**: Scientific concepts woven seamlessly into character experience

**Sensory Writing Requirements**
- Every scene must engage minimum three senses with specific, visceral details
- Physical sensations tied to emotional/psychological states
- Environmental details that reflect character consciousness state
- Synesthetic experiences during Cascade episodes (taste colors, hear geometry, feel equations)

**Dialogue Standards**
- Character-specific speech patterns reflecting background and transformation state
- Subtext layers: surface meaning, conscious intention, unconscious revelation
- Technical exposition integrated naturally through character expertise
- Street vernacular (Kora) vs. military precision (Sierra) vs. specialist terminology (Mileo)

### Chapter Structure & Formatting

**Chapter Headers**
```
# [NUMBER]: [TITLE]

[Primary Tag][Secondary Tag]

[Opening line with immediate sensory/emotional hook]
```

**Scene Tags System**
- **[Reflection]**: Internal consciousness exploration
- **[Action]**: Physical movement and confrontation
- **[Street]**: Underground/resistance perspective
- **[Cosmic]**: Network/Architect/Gardener perspective
- **[Transformation]**: Consciousness evolution sequences
- **[Connection]**: Character relationship development

**Section Breaks**
- Triple em-dash (---) for major time/location shifts
- Double line break for scene transitions within location
- Single line break for perspective shifts within scene

### Character Voice Distinctions

**Mileo Chen**
- **Pre-Link Extraction**: Mechanical precision, suppressed emotion, technical terminology
- **Post-Extraction**: Struggling with authentic expression, medical/specialist knowledge

- **Yggdrasil Network**: Ancient consciousness architecture

**Organizations**
- **NeuroSys**: Corporate entity managing neural optimization
- **NeuroSec**: Military enforcement division
- **The Resistance**: Underground consciousness liberation movement
- **The Gardeners**: Ancient cosmic consciousness cultivators

### Prose Style Requirements

**Sentence Architecture**
- **Rhythm Variation**: Alternate between terse fragments and flowing periods
- **Sensory Anchoring**: Abstract concepts grounded in physical sensation
- **Metaphor Integration**: Scientific concepts as lived experience
- **Emotional Precision**: Specific rather than generic emotional language

**Paragraph Flow**
- **Opening Hook**: Each paragraph begins with engaging sensory/emotional detail
- **Building Tension**: Escalating intensity through paragraph progression
- **Breathing Space**: Rhythmic variation between dense and sparse paragraphs
- **Transition Smoothness**: Seamless flow between internal/external focus

**Technical Description Standards**
- **Accessibility**: Complex concepts explained through character experience
- **Visceral Integration**: Technology felt in body, not just understood intellectually
- **Consequence Focus**: How technology affects human consciousness and relationships
- **Metaphor Bridge**: Scientific concepts linked to familiar human experiences

### Revision Priorities

**High Impact Revisions**
1. **Sensory Immersion**: Every scene must engage multiple senses viscerally
2. **Character Voice**: Distinctive speech patterns for each major character
3. **Emotional Authenticity**: Replace generic feelings with specific, visceral responses
