## "The Neural Wars: Fractured Code" - Complete Publisher Presentation

### Executive Summary

**THE NEURAL WARS: FRACTURED CODE** is literary science fiction that addresses the most urgent questions of our technological age: How do we maintain human agency in an era of consciousness-altering technology?

Set in 2207, the novel follows the transformation of Neo-Citania from consciousness prison to conscious community through the journeys of three protagonists whose awakening proves that liberation comes through transformation rather than destruction. The work combines the philosophical depth of literary fiction with the accessibility and scope of commercial science fiction, positioning it for both critical acclaim and broad market success.
