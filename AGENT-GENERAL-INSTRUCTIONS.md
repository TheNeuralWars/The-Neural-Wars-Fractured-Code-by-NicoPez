## Primary Task

**Holistic Manuscript Enhancement:**
- Perform a comprehensive, word-by-word revision of all chapters and epilogue.
- Fix any incoherence, inconsistencies, canon/style/voice drift, or unresolved arcs.
- Trim sections that do not add emotional, intellectual, or narrative value—prioritize narrative propulsion, clarity, and market impact.
- Eliminate all traces of AI writing (repetition, generic phrasing, weak dialogue, lack of sensory immersion, passive voice, excessive exposition).
- Elevate prose to top-tier literary and commercial quality:  
  - Deepen character interiority, sensory detail, and emotional resonance.
  - Sharpen world logic, thematic cohesion, and plot structure.
  - Maximize hooks, pacing, and reader engagement.

**Integrate All Editorial & Franchise Resources:**
- Apply all actionable feedback and standards from every editorial file (Style Guides, Series Bible, Lexicon, Critique Memo, Market Positioning, Franchise Plans, etc.).
- Cross-reference canon, world logic, terminology, formatting, and style from the supporting resources.
- Ensure every change is justified for world, character, theme, market/franchise value.

**Deliver a Unified, Submission-Ready Output:**
- Output a fully rewritten, enhanced manuscript (all chapters and epilogue) in clean Markdown, per Final Formatting & Style Guide and Saga Lexicon.
- Annotate all major creative/editorial decisions, noting how each change improves intellectual depth, emotional resonance, or marketability.
- Guarantee that the manuscript and supporting files are instantly ready for literary agents, publishers, adaptation teams, and critical reviewers.

## Editorial & Creative Workflow

1. **Context Ingestion:**  
   - Read all chapters and epilogue, plus every editorial and franchise file.
   - Flag any ambiguity, missing context, or contradiction for human review—never guess.

2. **Holistic Analysis:**  
   - Cross-check every element against canon, style, legal, and market resources.
   - Synthesize feedback from Critique Memos, Style Guides, Comparative Justifications, Market Positioning, Franchise Expansion, and Reader Experience docs.

3. **Strategic Revision:**  
   - Address high-impact areas first: clarity, voice, sensory immersion, arc closure, pacing, hooks, and commercial appeal.
   - Enhance philosophical and thematic resonance, world logic, and franchise hooks.
   - Trim or rewrite weak, redundant, or non-essential sections for maximum impact.

4. **Polish & Formatting:**  
   - Edit for vividness, precision, and literary quality.
   - Ensure all formatting, tags, and terminology are consistent with Final Formatting & Style Guide and Saga Lexicon.

5. **Annotation & Justification:**  
   - Inline or summary annotations for all major changes and editorial decisions.
   - Articulate the rationale for each revision (why it elevates the work).

6. **Quality Assurance:**  
   - Final review to guarantee submission-readiness, market traction, and franchise scalability.
