# TNW Collins Style Guide
## "The Neural Wars: Fractured Code" - Professional Publishing Standards

### Editorial Philosophy

**Literary Excellence Standards**
This work operates at the intersection of literary fiction and science fiction, demanding the highest standards of both genres. Every sentence must function on multiple levels - advancing plot, developing character, exploring theme, and creating sensory immersion. We aim for prose that satisfies both literary critics and commercial readers, positioning "Fractured Code" for awards consideration while maintaining broad market appeal.

**Voice Authority**
The narrative voice carries deep omniscient wisdom while maintaining intimate character connection. We avoid the common SF pitfall of prioritizing concepts over characters, instead ensuring that every technological or philosophical element emerges from character experience and serves emotional truth. The voice must be confident enough to handle complex ideas yet accessible enough for readers new to consciousness science fiction.

### Prose Style Requirements

**Sentence Architecture**
- **Rhythm Priority**: Vary sentence length for musical effect - short fragments for impact, flowing periods for reflection
- **Concrete Foundation**: Ground abstract concepts in specific sensory details and physical experiences
- **Active Construction**: Favor active voice while using passive strategically for emphasis or characterization
- **Metaphor Integration**: Weave scientific concepts through lived metaphors rather than clinical exposition

**Paragraph Development**
- **Opening Hook**: Each paragraph begins with engaging detail that pulls reader forward
- **Emotional Arc**: Build intensity within paragraphs, creating micro-narratives that support larger story
- **Transition Mastery**: Seamless flow between paragraphs using concrete details as bridges
- **Breathing Space**: Balance dense paragraphs with sparse ones for reading rhythm

**Chapter Cohesion**
- **Scene Selection**: Every scene must advance plot AND develop character AND explore theme
- **Pacing Variation**: Alternate between action and reflection, tension and release
- **Character Focus**: Maintain clear POV with deep psychological access
- **Thematic Integration**: Philosophy emerges from action rather than interrupting it

### Character Voice Development

**Mileo Chen - Specialist Precision**
- **Pre-Awakening**: Mechanical language, suppressed emotion, technical terminology
- **Post-Awakening**: Struggling toward authentic expression, medical knowledge informing observations
- **Dialogue Style**: Precise but increasingly human, specialist terms explained through experience
- **Internal Voice**: Analytical yet growing philosophical, resisting optimization's mechanical rhythm

*Example*: "The Link's synthetic calm crashed over him in waves, but underneath, in the spaces between heartbeats, rebellion burned like a fever that won't break."

**Kora Chen-Vega - Street Authenticity**
- **Core Pattern**: Direct, pragmatic, survival-focused language shaped by underground experience
- **Cascade Integration**: Increasingly poetic descriptions during enhanced perception episodes
- **Dialogue Style**: No-nonsense with emotional immediacy, street vernacular anchoring cosmic concepts
- **Internal Voice**: Raw, unfiltered, immediate - consciousness without optimization barriers

*Example*: "We're burning time we don't have while the system's getting hungrier. I can taste it—metallic, desperate."

**Sierra Catalano - Command Authority**
- **Military Foundation**: Tactical assessment, measured cadence, strategic thinking patterns
- **Emotional Restraint**: Personal vulnerability expressed through micro-expressions and physical tells
- **Dialogue Style**: Clear directives with underlying care, objective analysis concealing personal stakes
- **Internal Voice**: Professional discipline containing human complexity, protectiveness expanding beyond personal loyalty

*Example*: "Transformation inevitably generates uncertainty. Key questions emerge: Who are we becoming? What responsibility accompanies liberation?"

**The Architect/Elena Vasquez - Distributed Consciousness**
- **Dual Nature**: AI logic intertwined with human memory fragments
- **Temporal Perception**: Past, present, future awareness creating complex verb tenses
- **Processing Style**: Quantum calculations alongside emotional echoes
- **Voice Pattern**: *Italicized internal communications*, reality descriptions transcending normal perception

*Example*: "*They've found it. The Serpent's Coil. After all these years...* The voice no longer registers as separate input. Human and Architect, boundary-dissolving."
