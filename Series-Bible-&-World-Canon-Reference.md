### Foundational Premises

**The Consciousness Paradigm**
- **Core Principle**: Consciousness is the fundamental force of the universe, more basic than matter or energy
- **Network Theory**: Ancient consciousness infrastructure (Yggdrasil) predates and underlies all technological development
- **Human Uniqueness**: Humanity's rare ability to balance individual identity with collective awareness
- **Evolution Path**: Voluntary consciousness enhancement rather than forced optimization or absorption

**The Neural Wars Universe**
- **Primary Setting**: Earth in near-future where consciousness technology has reached critical mass
- **Central Conflict**: Control versus connection, optimization versus authentic evolution

### Consciousness Physics & Universal Laws

**Fundamental Principles**
- **Consciousness Conservation**: Awareness cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed
- **Choice Sovereignty**: Consciousness enhancement requires ongoing voluntary participation
- **Individual Persistence**: Personal identity strengthens rather than dissolves through authentic connection
- **Network Resonance**: Consciousness architectures naturally seek harmony and mutual support

**Enhancement Mechanics**
